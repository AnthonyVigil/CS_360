Mobile Architect &amp; Programming

- Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
  - The requirements for this application included a database which will store the items, ability to modify or edit items, user login, SMS alerts when items are low in stock, and a username database. 
- What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
  - In total, there were about 4 screens and 2 pop ups, login screen, forgot password pop up, register screen, item list screen, edit item pop up, and adding items screen. The design helped create a fluid experience where the user is transitioned to the activity they desire once the buttons are clicked. The UI design kept the user in mind by establishing a simple yet practical layout.
- How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?
  - Coding the application was challenging. It started with understanding the layout as a user and going down the path of the tasks. The database had to be created to save the items and users, so it was created first. Then, I worked on the login which is the first screen that the user utilizes. After coding one screen, the rest of them became more easier to work on, as there is a starting point now.
- How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?
  - I tested the functionality by running the application on an emulator for the Google Pixel 4A, API 30, android 11. It showed me that some buttons were not functional so I did added click listeners to guide the button to certain funtions. It is important to test the application because some bugs or errors could be present on the emulation of the app but not in the code, so it allowed me to see where the issues were.
- Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
  - I had to innovate to overcome a challenge in the coding part of the application. It was the most challenging trying to figure out which imports would help with the functions required in the application. Intensive research was needed to ensure the coding was optimal for the application.
- In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
  - I believe the UI is the most successful; I tailored it to the user and allowed for plenty of space for the list of the items. As for the coding part, I would say the user and item databases, I tested them by printing the saved information in a small pop up and it worked perfectly.
